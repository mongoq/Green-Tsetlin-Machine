# C-Code for inference

1.) Either perform a new training with the Jupyter Notebook and generate new trained_votes.h file or keep the existing.

2.) Draw a new MIST figure 'pixel_data.h' with pixel_painter.py or keep the existing 'pixel_data.h'.

3.) Run 'make predict'. It should display a '6' as an inference result. Always compare 'pixel_data.h' "with your own eyes" with the inference result.
