# Pixel Painter

This little tool can be used to draw 28x28 pixel images and export them as .h or .pkl files.

In this project, the filenames 'pixel_data.h' and 'pixel_data.pkl' were consistently used to ensure compatibility.

The .h file can be used with the C-Code and the .pkl file can be used with the Jupyter Notebook's upload feature.
