# Green-Tsetlin-Machine
Getting Sondre Glimsdal's Green Tsetlin Machine Framework to work "in under 10 minutes"

This project tries to simplify the assembly and evaluation process of a Green Tsetlin Machine that can train and classify images of the MNIST dataset.

A Google Colab (Pro) notebook (.ipynb file) can be used to train and classify 28x28 pixel binary images.

A small Python script "Pixel Painter" can be used to draw the digits 0-9 and save the resulting 28x28 pixel image either as a .pkl or .h file.

A .pkl (Pickle) file can be uploaded to the Google Colab (Pro) and classified by the notebook.

A .h file (C-header) can be exported and used with a makefile to perform the inference using C-code only on a local computer.

TODO:  
> Colab Notebook + Pixel Painter  
    Makefile + .h + .c + Explanation, so it can be compiled with standard pixel_data.h  
    Documentation Colab Notebook - minus Hyperparameter sweep + Upload / Download  
    Size of .h file is result of number of clauses (!)  
    ESP32 compatibility ?  
    FPGA Verilog / Verilator port with pixel painter add-on for Verilog array output
